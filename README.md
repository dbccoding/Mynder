## Security

### Encryption

- **AES-GCM 256-bit encryption**: Military-grade encryption for all stored data
- **PBKDF2 key derivation**: Password is hashed with 100,000 iterations
- **Unique IVs**: Each encrypted item uses a unique initialization vector
- **No plain text storage**: All journals, tasks, and events are encrypted before being saved

### Password System

- Password is required to access the app
- Encryption key derived from your password
- Password hash stored separately for verification
- Encryption key exists only in memory while app is unlocked
- When locked, encryption key is completely wiped from memory

### Data Storage

- Uses Dexie (IndexedDB wrapper) for encrypted data storage
- Much larger storage capacity than localStorage (typically 50MB+)
- Better performance for large datasets
- All data remains local to your device

### Important Security Notes

- Password is NOT recoverable - if you forget it, your data is permanently lost
- Write down your password and store it securely
- No backdoor or master key exists
- Data cannot be accessed without the correct password
- Encryption key is never stored on disk

## Technical Details

- **Dependencies**: Dexie v3.2.4 (loaded via CDN)
- **Encryption**: Web Crypto API (built into modern browsers)
- **Responsive design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Data persistence**: IndexedDB with AES-GCM encryption
- **Storage capacity**: 50MB+ (browser dependent)

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers that support:
- ES6 JavaScript
- Web Crypto API (for encryption)
- IndexedDB API
- Notification API (optional, for enhanced notifications)

## Privacy

All data is stored locally in your browser with AES-256 encryption. No data is sent to external servers. Your journal entries, tasks, and events remain completely private on your device. Even if someone gains access to your device's storage, the data is encrypted and cannot be read without your password.
