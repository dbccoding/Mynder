### Mood Ring Feature

The app analyzes the sentiment of your journal entries using the PAD (Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance) emotional model and reflects your mood through subtle background colors:

- **Excited/Joyful** (high pleasure + energy): Warm golden background (#FFF4D6)
- **Calm/Content** (high pleasure + low energy): Soft peachy background (#FFEEE0)
- **Anxious/Stressed** (low pleasure + high energy): Cool lavender background (#E8DFF5)
- **Sad/Melancholic** (low pleasure + low energy): Blue-gray background (#E0EBF5)
- **Neutral**: Light gray background (#F5F7FA)

**How it works:**
- When you save a journal entry, the app analyzes emotional keywords
- Background color smoothly transitions (3 seconds) to reflect the detected mood
- On app load, the background reflects your most recent entry's mood
- Toggle the "Mood Ring" switch in the header to enable/disable this feature
- Your preference is saved

**Privacy:** All sentiment analysis happens locally in your browser - no data is sent anywhere.

### Intelligent Messaging

The app provides three types of contextual messages to create a supportive journaling experience:

**1. Supportive Messages** (bottom notification after saving):
- **Time-aware**: Different messages for late night, early morning, morning, and evening entries
- **Frequency-aware**: Acknowledges when you're journaling multiple times per day
- **Return patterns**: Welcomes you back after gaps in journaling
- **Length-aware**: Responds appropriately to short check-ins vs. long reflections

**2. Welcome Messages** (top banner on app load):
- **Daily users**: Brief, warm greeting
- **Regular users** (1 day gap): Friendly check-in
- **Returning users** (2-4 days): Acknowledging absence without pressure
- **Long absence** (5+ days): Supportive, no-judgment welcome back

**3. Coach Messages** (top banner after saving, appears 4.5 seconds after supportive message):
- Based on sentiment analysis of your journal entry
- Provides empathetic reflections on your emotional state
- Offers gentle guidance and validation
- Examples:
  - Excited/Joyful: "Your energy is contagious right now! Let's capture this feeling..."
  - Calm/Content: "There's a real sense of peace in your words. That's worth acknowledging."
  - Anxious/Stressed: "I can sense some tension here. Writing it down is the first step..."
  - Sad/Depressed: "It's okay to have days like this. You showed up, and that matters."
  - Low Control: "When things feel out of control, small actions can help..."
  - High Control: "You sound ready to tackle what's ahead. That determination is powerful."

All messages are designed to be supportive without being intrusive, creating a sense of companionship in your journaling practice.

## Security

### Encryption

- **AES-GCM 256-bit encryption**: Military-grade encryption for all stored data
- **PBKDF2 key derivation**: Password is hashed with 100,000 iterations
- **Master key architecture**: A random master key encrypts your data, which is itself encrypted with both your password and recovery key
- **Unique IVs**: Each encrypted item uses a unique initialization vector
- **No plain text storage**: All journals, tasks, and events are encrypted before being saved

### Password System

- Password required to access the app
- Master encryption key derived from your password
- Password hash stored separately for verification
- Encryption key exists only in memory while app is unlocked
- When locked, encryption key is completely wiped from memory

### Recovery Key System

- 12-word recovery phrase generated during setup
- Provides emergency access if password is forgotten
- Master key is encrypted with both password AND recovery key
- Recovery key uses same encryption strength as password
- Must be stored securely by user

**Recovery Key Best Practices:**
- Write it down on paper and store in a safe place
- Save in a password manager
- Never share it with anyone
- Don't store it in the same place as your password
- Consider printing multiple copies for redundancy

### Data Storage

- Uses Dexie (IndexedDB wrapper) for encrypted data storage
- Much larger storage capacity than localStorage (typically 50MB+)
- Better performance for large datasets
- All data remains local to your device
- **Sentiment data**: Each journal entry includes encrypted sentiment scores (pleasure, arousal, dominance) for mood tracking

### Important Security Notes

- Password is NOT stored anywhere - only a hash for verification
- Recovery key provides secure backup access
- Your data can be recovered with EITHER password OR recovery key
- Both must be kept secure - anyone with either can access your data
- Master encryption key is never stored unencrypted
- Encryption key is never stored on disk
- All cryptographic operations use Web Crypto API (browser's built-in security)
- **Sentiment analysis**: Happens entirely in-browser - no data sent to external services

## Technical Details

## Privacy

All data is stored locally in your browser with AES-256 encryption. No data is sent to external servers. Your journal entries, tasks, and events remain completely private on your device. Even if someone gains access to your device's storage, the data is encrypted and cannot be read without your password.

**Privacy Highlights:**
- **Zero external communication**: No analytics, no tracking, no data collection
- **Local sentiment analysis**: All emotional analysis happens in your browser
- **Encrypted sentiment data**: Even mood scores are encrypted before storage
